## Description

This app is a simple README file generator that will generate a professional read me file for your projects.  All information is handled by questions that will be asked by the console.  This application was an exercise to get used to running Javascript applications through node.js, and using some node modules such as the FS (file system) and inquirer modules.  This was also the first time that I have used modulation between two seperate javascript files.  

## Installation
Simply fork or copy the repository, cd into the repo on your machine, and then run `npm install` in order to install the inquirer package.   

## Usage

[![Youtube Video Tutorial](https://img.youtube.com/vi/ThE2ezoN_AY/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThE2ezoN_AY)


When you cd into the repo, type `node index.js` into the console and answer the prompts.  Once you are finished, a README-Template.md file will be generated for you to copy and paste to whatever project you would like to use it for.  

Any prompts that you leave blank will not be included in the readme file.
